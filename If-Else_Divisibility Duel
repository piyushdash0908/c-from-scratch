*/
Three contenders— X, Y, and Z are facing off in a duel of divisibility. Your task is to determine the result of this epic showdown by analyzing the relationship between X and its challengers, Y and Z.

The rules of the duel are as follows:

If X is divisible by Y, the output should be "Y triumphs over X!".
If X is divisible by Z, the output should be "Z outsmarts X!".
If X is divisible by both Y and Z, the output should be "X defeats all!".
If X is not divisible by either Y or Z, the output should be "X remains undefeated!".
Input Format

A single line containing three integers X, Y, and Z

Constraints

1 ≤ X, Y, Z ≤ 10^9

Output Format

A single line containing one of the following results:

"X defeats all!"
"Y triumphs over X!"
"Z outsmarts X!"
"X remains undefeated!"
Sample Input 0

28 7 3
Sample Output 0

Y triumphs over X!
Sample Input 1

33 5 11
Sample Output 1

Z outsmarts X!
